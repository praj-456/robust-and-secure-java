Strong Typing: Java is a strongly typed language, which means that it enforces strict type-checking during compilation. 
This helps catch errors at compile-time rather than at runtime, reducing the likelihood of unexpected behaviors and vulnerabilities.

Memory Management: Java has an automatic memory management system through garbage collection. 
This feature relieves developers from manually managing memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks and buffer overflows.

Exception Handling: Java has built-in exception handling mechanisms that allow developers to handle runtime errors gracefully.
By catching and handling exceptions, Java programs can continue executing without crashing, enhancing overall robustness.

Security Manager: Java provides a built-in security manager that allows developers to define and enforce security policies for Java applications. 
It provides fine-grained control over the operations that a program can perform, such as accessing the file system or network resources. This helps prevent unauthorized actions and protects against malicious code.

Bytecode Verification: Java uses bytecode as an intermediate representation of the code, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Before execution, the bytecode goes through a verification process, ensuring that it adheres to certain safety constraints. This verification helps prevent malicious code from exploiting vulnerabilities and compromising the system.

Sandbox Environment: Java applets and applications can run within a sandboxed environment, which restricts their access to system resources. 
This sandboxing feature provides an additional layer of security by preventing untrusted code from performing harmful actions.

Robust Standard Library: Java has a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of APIs for common programming tasks. 
The standard library undergoes rigorous testing and is continuously improved, making it reliable and less prone to errors.

Platform Independence: Java programs are compiled into platform-independent bytecode, which can be executed on any system that has a compatible JVM. 
This portability helps ensure consistent behavior and reduces the risk of platform-specific vulnerabilities.

Regular Updates and Security Patches: The Java platform is actively maintained by Oracle, and security updates and patches are regularly released to address any identified vulnerabilities. 
This commitment to security helps keep Java applications robust and secure.
